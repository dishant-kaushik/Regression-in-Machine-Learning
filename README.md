Regression Analysis with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Regression Analysis with Machine Learning repository! This project focuses on implementing and understanding various regression techniques 
in machine learning to predict continuous outcomes.

Introduction

Regression analysis is a fundamental concept in supervised machine learning, where the goal is to predict a continuous variable based on one or more predictors. 
This repository contains code and  datasets to explore and implement various regression algorithms, including:

Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
